    <p>What I created</p>
    <p> In this class I created a few websites</p>
    <ol>
        <li>My favorite things</li>
        <img src="">
        <li>An about me page</li>
        <img src="">

    </ol>
    <div>
        <h2> how I created them</h2>
        <h1>How my favorite things website works</h1>
        <h2>How does the project work overall</h2>
        <p>It works well, the code for the images pastes the images, the header made the header, and the paragraph made the paragraph
        </p>
        <h2>What are some specifics of the code and how do those work</h2>
        <p> img src=”url” allowed me to paste the image onto the page </p>
        <h2>Choices I had and how I went about making them</h2>
        <p> a p tag p allowed me to add context and write a paragraph </p>
        <h2>One thing that I would change if I had more time</h2>
        <p>If I had more time I would improve the way that it looks.</p>
